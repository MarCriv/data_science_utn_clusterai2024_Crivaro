# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Portfolio! This repository showcases three hands-on projects developed as part of the Data Science course in the Industrial Engineering program at UTN. Each project explores a unique domain and applies essential data science concepts, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to supervised machine learning.  

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview  

### 1. **Diabetes Prediction: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Objective:** Predict the likelihood of diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.  
- **Dataset:** Sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, this dataset focuses exclusively on female patients and adheres to specific selection criteria.  
- **Key Insights:**  
  - Conducted an in-depth EDA to uncover trends, correlations, and potential predictors for diabetes.  
  - Explored relationships between variables such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure to identify key contributors.  

### 2. **Airbnb Price Prediction: Machine Learning**  
- **Objective:** Predict nightly rental prices for Airbnb listings using a supervised machine learning model.  
- **Dataset:** Airbnb property dataset, including features like location, property type, amenities, and reviews.  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Built and tuned regression models to accurately estimate rental prices.  
  - Identified critical factors driving price variations, offering valuable insights for hosts and travelers.  

### 3. **Customer Churn Prediction: EDA + Machine Learning**  
- **Objective:** Help a telecom company predict which customers are likely to churn.  
- **Dataset:** A dataset of 7,043 customers with 21 variables detailing customer characteristics and behaviors.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Performed comprehensive EDA to understand customer behavior and identify potential churn indicators.  
  - Developed predictive models to estimate churn probability, assisting the company in improving customer retention strategies.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Portfolio Stands Out  
- Demonstrates proficiency in EDA, data visualization, and feature engineering.  
- Showcases experience with supervised machine learning for predictive analytics.  
- Tackles real-world problems with practical applications across industries.  

Feel free to explore the projects and their detailed documentation. This portfolio reflects my dedication to applying data science to solve meaningful challenges and create actionable insights.
